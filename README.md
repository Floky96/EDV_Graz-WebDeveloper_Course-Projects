# EDV_Graz-WebDeveloper_Course-Projects

 In 2022 I advanced my education and completed a Web Developer Course at EDV-Graz. There I learned the basics of HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript and more. I also learned how to use GitHub Desktop.
 Through various small projects the tech stack was expanded and the foundations were laid for the final project.
 As a final project I was tasked to create a ToDo-List. It was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a simple ToDo-List that allows you to add, delete and edit tasks, while also allowing you to mark them as important or completed.

 Tech Stack from the course:
 HTML, 
 CSS/SCSS, 
 Javascript, 
 Python, 
 UI/UX Design, 
 WordPress (Webpack, Node.js, PHP, MySQL, AdobeXD, WordPress Theme Development)
